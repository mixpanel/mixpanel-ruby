## What
JsonLogic rules are JSON trees. The engine walks that tree and returns a Ruby value.

## Install

```bash
gem install json-logic-rb
```

## Quick start

```ruby
require 'json_logic'

rule = { "+" => [1, 2, 3] }

JsonLogic.apply(rule)
# => 6.0
```

With data:

```ruby
JsonLogic.apply({ "var" => "user.age" }, { "user" => { "age" => 42 } })
# => 42
```

## How

There are **two types of operations** in this implementation: Default Operations and Lazy Operations.

### 1. Default Operations

For **Default Operations**, the engine **evaluates all arguments first** and then calls the operator with the **resulting Ruby values**.
This matches the reference behavior for arithmetic, comparisons, string operations, and other pure operations that do not control evaluation order.

**Groups and references:**

- [Numeric operations](https://jsonlogic.com/operations.html#numeric-operations)
- [String operations](https://jsonlogic.com/operations.html#string-operations)
- [Array operations](https://jsonlogic.com/operations.html#array-operations) — simple transforms like `merge`, membership `in`.

### 2. Lazy Operations

Some operations must control **whether** and **when** their arguments are evaluated. They implement branching, short-circuiting, or “apply a rule per item” semantics. For these **Lazy Operations**, the engine passes **raw sub-rules** and current data. The operator then evaluates only the sub-rules it actually needs.

**Groups and references:**

- **Branching / boolean control** — `if`, `?:`, `and`, `or`, `var`
  [Logic & boolean operations](https://jsonlogic.com/operations.html#logic-and-boolean-operations) • [Truthiness](https://jsonlogic.com/truthy.html)

- **Enumerable operators** — `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `all`, `none`, `some`
  [Array operations](https://jsonlogic.com/operations.html#array-operations)

**How enumerable per-item evaluation works:**

1. The first argument is a rule that returns the list of items — evaluated **once** to a Ruby array.
2. The second argument is the per-item rule — evaluated **for each item** with that item as the **current root**.
3. For `reduce`, the current item is also available as `"current"`, and the running total as `"accumulator"`.


**Example #1**

```ruby
# filter: keep numbers >= 2
JsonLogic.apply(
  { "filter" => [ { "var" => "ints" }, { ">=" => [ { "var" => "" }, 2 ] } ] },
  { "ints" => [1,2,3] }
)
# => [2, 3]
```

**Example #2**

```ruby
# reduce: sum using "current" and "accumulator"
JsonLogic.apply(
  { "reduce" => [
      { "var" => "ints" },
      { "+" => [ { "var" => "accumulator" }, { "var" => "current" } ] }, 0 ]
  },
  { "ints" => [1,2,3,4] }
)
# => 10.0
```

### Why laziness matters?

Lazy operations **prevent evaluation** of branches you do not need. If division by zero raised an error (hypothetically), lazy control would avoid it:

```ruby
# "or" short-circuits: 1 is truthy, so the right side is NOT evaluated.
# If the right side were evaluated eagerly, it would attempt 1/0 (error).
JsonLogic.apply({ "or" => [1, { "/" => [1, 0] }] })
# => 1
```

> In this gem `/` returns `nil` on divide‑by‑zero, but these examples show **why** lazy evaluation is required by the spec: branching and boolean operators must **not** evaluate unused branches.

## Adding Operations

Need a custom operation? It’s straightforward.

### Quick — register a Proc or Lambda

Register little anonymous functions, by passing a Proc or Lambda.

```ruby
JsonLogic.add_operation("times2") { |(value), _| value.to_i * 2 }
```

Once the function added, you can use it in your logic.

```ruby
JsonLogic.apply({ "times2" => [21] })
# => 42
```

Is useful for rapid prototyping with minimal boilerplate;
Later you can “promote” it into a full class or use additional features.


### 1) Pick the Operation type
Choose one of:
- **Default**
```ruby
class JsonLogic::Operations::StartsWith < JsonLogic::Operation; end
```
For anonymous functions:
```ruby
JsonLogic.add_operation("starts_with", lazy: false) do; end
```
- **Lazy**
```ruby
class JsonLogic::Operations::StartsWith < JsonLogic::LazyOperation; end
```
For anonymous functions:
```ruby
JsonLogic.add_operation("starts_with", lazy: true) do; end
```

See [§How](#how) for details.

### 2) Enable JsonLogic Semantics (optional)
Enable semantics to mirror JsonLogic’s comparison/truthiness in Ruby:

```ruby
using JsonLogic::Semantics
```


See [§JsonLogic Semantic](#jsonlogic-semantic) for details.

### 3) Create an Operation and provide a machine name

Operation methods use a consistent call shape.

- The first parameter is the **array of operator arguments**.
- The second is the current **data**.



Thanks to Ruby’s destructuring, you can unpack the argument array right in the method signature.

```ruby
class JsonLogic::Operations::StartsWith < JsonLogic::Operation
  def self.name = "starts_with"
  def call((str, prefix), _data)
    # str, prefix are ALREADY evaluated to Ruby values
    str.to_s.start_with?(prefix.to_s)
  end
end
```

### 4) Register the new operation

```ruby
JsonLogic::Engine.default.registry.register(JsonLogic::Operations::StartsWith)
```

After registration, use it in rules:

```json
{ "starts_with": [ { "var": "email" }, "admin@" ] }
```



## JsonLogic Semantic

All supported Operations follow JsonLogic semantics.

### Comparisons
As JsonLogic primary developed in JavaScript it inherits JavaScript's type coercion in build-in Operations. JsonLogic (JS‑style) comparisons coerce types; Ruby does not.

**JavaScript:**

```js
1 >= "1.0" // true
```

**Ruby:**

```ruby
1 >= "1.0"
# ArgumentError: comparison of Integer with String failed
```

**Ruby (with JsonLogic semantics enabled):**

```ruby
using JsonLogic::Semantics

1 >= "1.0" # => true
```

### Truthiness

JsonLogic’s truthiness differs from Ruby’s (see <https://jsonlogic.com/truthy.html>).
In Ruby, only `false` and `nil` are falsey. In JsonLogic empty strings and empty arrays are also falsey.

**In Ruby:**
```ruby
!![]
# => true
```

While JsonLogic as was mentioned before has it's own truthiness:

**In Ruby (with JsonLogic Semantic):**

```ruby
include JsonLogic::Semantics

truthy?([])
# => false
```


## Compliance and tests

Optional: quick self-test



```bash
ruby test/selftest.rb
```


Official test suite

1. Fetch the official suite



```bash
mkdir -p spec/tmp
curl -fsSL https://jsonlogic.com/tests.json -o spec/tmp/tests.json
```

2. Run it

```bash
ruby script/compliance.rb spec/tmp/tests.json
```

  Expected output

```bash
# => Compliance: X/X passed
```

## Security

- Rules are **data**, not code; no Ruby eval.
- Operations are **pure** (no IO, no network, no shell).
- Rules have **no write** access to anything.
