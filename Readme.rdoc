= mixpanel-ruby: The official Mixpanel Ruby library

mixpanel-ruby is a library for tracking events and sending \Mixpanel profile
updates to \Mixpanel from your ruby applications. It's straightforward to
get started sending your first events and updates:

== Installation

    gem install mixpanel-ruby

== Getting Started

    require 'mixpanel-ruby'
    
    tracker = Mixpanel::Tracker.new(YOUR_TOKEN)
    
    # Track an event on behalf of user "User1"
    tracker.track('User1', 'A Mixpanel Event')
    
    # Send an update to User1's profile
    tracker.people.set('User1', {
        '$first_name' => 'David',
        '$last_name' => 'Bowie',
        'Best Album' => 'The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'
    })

The primary class you will use to track events is Mixpanel::Tracker. An instance of
Mixpanel::Tracker is enough to send events directly to \Mixpanel, and get you integrated
right away.
