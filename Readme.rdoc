= mixpanel-ruby: The official Mixpanel Ruby library

mixpanel-ruby is a library for tracking events and sending \Mixpanel profile
updates to \Mixpanel from your ruby applications. It's straightforward to
get started sending your first events and updates:

== Installation

    gem install mixpanel-ruby

== Getting Started

    require 'mixpanel-ruby'

    tracker = Mixpanel::Tracker.new(YOUR_TOKEN)

    # Track an event on behalf of user "User1"
    tracker.track('User1', 'A Mixpanel Event')

    # Send an update to User1's profile
    tracker.people.set('User1', {
        '$first_name' => 'David',
        '$last_name' => 'Bowie',
        'Best Album' => 'The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'
    })

The primary class you will use to track events is Mixpanel::Tracker. An instance of
Mixpanel::Tracker is enough to send events directly to \Mixpanel, and get you integrated
right away.

== Changes

== 1.2.0
* All objects with a "strftime" method will be formatted as dates in
  people updates.

== 1.1.0
* The default consumer now sends requests (and expects responses) in
  verbose, JSON mode, which may improve error reporting.

=== 1.0.2
* Allow ip and optional_params arguments to be accepted by all
  Mixpanel::People methods (except #destroy_user)

=== 1.0.1
* Compatibility with earlier versions of ruby. Library development will continue
  to target 1.9, so later versions may not be compatible with Ruby 1.8, but we
  love patches!

=== 1.0.0
* tracker#import added
* Change to internal tracking message format. Messages written
  by earlier versions of the library will not work with 1.0.0 consumer classes.
* alias bugfixed
* Fixes to tests to allow for different timezones
* Support for optional/experimental people api properties in people calls
