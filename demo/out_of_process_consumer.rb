# As your application scales, it's likely you'll want to
# to detect events in one place and send them somewhere
# else. For example, you might write the events to a queue
# to be consumed by another process.
#
# This demo shows how you might do things, using
# the block constructor in Mixpanel to enqueue events,
# and a MixpanelBufferedConsumer to send them to
# Mixpanel

# Mixpanel uses the Net::HTTP library, which by default
# will not verify remote SSL certificates. In your app,
# you'll need to call Mixpanel.config_http with the path
# to your Certificate authority resources, or the library
# won't verify the remote certificate identity.

  http.ca_file = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
  http.use_ssl = true
